* Multigrid Game POC
  The goal of this game is to create a game using any type of grid tile. Lines, squares, octagons, etc. The controls will allow shooting, turning, and moving forward (to the next tile).
  
  The kicker is, maps can contain multiple tile shapes. The geometry will be fun to implement!
* Tested Dependencies
  SFML-2.5.1
